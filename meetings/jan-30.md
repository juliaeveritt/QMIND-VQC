# January 30th
Location: TBD

### Agenda:
- Parameterized circuit demo and presentations
- Next steps: Training
  
### Notes
- *Gradients* - Tristan
  - Look at methods like finite difference, parameter shift, natural gradient, and Hessians
  - Pennylane and qiskit have some decent explanations and tutorials
- *EVs and Sampling vs Probabilities* - Julia
  - I want you to look into objects like `CircuitSampler` and PauliExpectation`
  - What do `convert()` functions do?
  - Look at the notebook but here are some links [1](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/operators/01_operator_flow.ipynb) [2](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/17402/qiskit-transpilation-and-the-circuitsampler)
- *Optimizers* - Robbie
  - Look into gradient descent, SPSA, and COBYLA
  - How do they work with the NN? Differences, benefits?
- *Neural Network Objects* - Connor
  - Look into `OpFlowQNN`, `NeuralNetworkClassifier`, `CircuiatQNN`, and `VQC`
  - What are their capabilities? try out some different implementations
  - Qiskit has some tutorials
- Look at the notebook I sent in Slack
- Use the [model-example](https://github.com/mattwright99/QMIND-VQC/blob/main/src/model-example.ipynb) to run some tests and start you off

### Action Items
- Push your parameterized circuit code.
- Learn all about your topic assigned above, run some tests, write some code, and get ready to teach us about it for Feb 9
