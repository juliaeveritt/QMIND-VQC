# October 20, 2021
Location: BHM 117

### Agenda:
- T-shirts!
- Check in from last last week of individual study
  - What did you learn?
  - What did you struggle with?
- Plan for next week: miniprojects
  - Choose a famous quantum algorithm from the list below and implement it
    - Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm
    - Simon's Algorithm
    - Grover's Algorithm
  - I recommend starting with the [qiskit textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html)
  - The goal is to learn all about your algorithm, implement it in Qiskit, and compare it agains the classical algorithm
  
### Notes
- This repo will be the source of everything moving forward (meeting notes, code, task management, etc) so let's make it sick
- The primer has some typos in it (my b)
- The [microsoft QC video](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/quantum-computing-computer-scientists/) has been helpful
- I recommend creating an [IBM quantum account](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) - it will give you access to their online IDE with everything installed, the drag-and-drop circuit composer which is really useful for visualizing you circuit, and you can submit jobs to run on real hardware

### Action Items
- Complete your mini project by October 27 (next meeting)
- 1-1s with me
