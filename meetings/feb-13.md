# Feb 13
Location: Zoom	

### Agenda:
- Present your feature!
- Talk about next steps
  
### Notes
- We will be specializing out model for image classification in the coming weeks
- I am still figuring out what the best way to split up the work is so you can all relax until Wednesday
- Some of the things we will be looking at:
  - Dimensionality reduction. We have 28x28 images but need to encode all that data in a few qubits so we will look into PCA and autoencoders
  - [Quantum Autencoders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.02806.pdf)
  - [Quantum Convolutional NNs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03787.pdf)
  - [Quanvolutional NN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04767.pdf)

### Action Items
- Send your slide shows to the slack channel and push any code.
- Take a look at some of the concepts above to prep.
- Focus on midterms and assignements!
