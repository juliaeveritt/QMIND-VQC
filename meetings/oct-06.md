Agenda:
- Welcome to the team!
- Introductions:
   - Ice breaker: Favourite pizza
   - Name, program, and year
   - Quick background
- Project
   - We are the “Variational Quantum Classifier” team. This is really exciting because it is a very modern and active are of research. The idea of variational quantum circuits was discovered in like 2014. 
   - This project lies at the intersection of machine learning and quantum computing
   - Why QML? Enhanced feature spaces and efficient dot products
   - GitHub for project management
- Timeline
   - First month (next 3 weeks) we are going to spend onboarding
   - I am still deciding precisely how I want to split this project up because there are enough independent components to go around and that would move the project along quickly but that’s not as much fun cuz there is less teamwork and your learning is much more narrow. I also don’t want you all working on the same thing so I will probably go for the happy medium of teams of two.
   - We will start with an classic binary classification task (likely the Iris dataset) and build a variation quantum classifier from the ground up using the state of the art QML tools 
   - Few weeks on encoding data and quantum circuit architecture
   - Few weeks on optimization related tasks
   - Testing it all together
      - End of first semester
   - Extend the model:
   - Multiclass classification
   - Different model architectures (convolutional QNN, q autoencoder)
   - More complicated data encoding
- Onboarding plan/next steps
   - 1 week: what is quantum computing
      - Primer
      - Articles
      - Videos
   - 2 weeks: miniprojects
   - 1 week: what are variational quantum algorithms
