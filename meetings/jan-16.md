# January 16th
Location: https://queensu.zoom.us/j/99694747062?pwd=OTQ2RjluZFFLdzlBcytXRkNucW5oZz09

### Agenda:
- Welcome back!
- Ice breaker: Favourite Holiday tradition?
- Individual updates
- What function do you want to implement?
- Availability at 5:30 on Wednesdays
- Winter kick-off
- Journal club?
- MD applications

  
### Notes
- Write a function to implement your specific algorithm. Inputs are up to you but I would recommend looking at qiskit or pennylane docs for some ideas. Should output a `QuantumCircuit` object with parameterized quantum gates.
- We will schedule a second weekly meeting at 5:30pm on Wednesdays. We will use the Wednesday slot as a ~30 minute sync up and go over tasks for the following week. The 3pm Sunday slot will become a 5 minute scrum followed by an optional work period where we work on your task and debug together. 
- Let me know if you plan on applying to MD

### Action Items
- Implement your function for next Wednesday (01/26)
