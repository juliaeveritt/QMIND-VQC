# November 11
Location: BMH 116

### Agenda:
- Go over VQA research
- Split into teams:
  - Feature map
  - Ansatz
  
### Notes
- Good work on learning about VQA, now it is time to dive into each part and build our variational quantum classifier!
- We are splitting into teams of two:
  1. Julia and Connor will be focussing on feature maps
  2. Tristan and Robbie will be looking into the ansatz
- I want you guys to be able to teach the group about your topic, describe the what the current standard approach(s) are, and pick one specific method/algorithm to implement.
- I suggest completing the above task for next week and then get to implementation in the following week but it is up to you.
- Next week you will give a very informal run down on your topic and what your plan is and then on the 24th you and your partner will actually give a short presentation on your work.
- We will talk more about implementation next week but I want you to build a function that instantiates a quantum circuit, builds the parameterized circuit according to your method, and returns the circuit.

### Action Items
- Come next week with some information/updates to share with the team about your topic.
- Have a specific algorithm/technique you want to focus on.
- By Nov. 24th, I want you to have a implemented a gate-based function that returns the appropriate quantum circuit and a breif presentation teaching the rest of the team what you learned. A slide deck would be nice - it doesn't have to be super fancy but I find visualizations often go a long way in QC
